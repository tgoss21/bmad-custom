# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Context

The BMAD Method uses various checklists to ensure quality and completeness of different artifacts. Each checklist contains embedded prompts and instructions to guide the LLM through thorough validation and advanced elicitation. The checklists automatically identify their required artifacts and guide the validation process.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

==================== START: tasks#advanced-elicitation ====================
# Advanced Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of ideas through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple analytical perspectives

## Task Instructions

### 1. Section Context and Review

[[LLM: When invoked after outputting a section:

1. First, provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented (e.g., "Please review the technology choices for completeness and alignment with your project needs. Pay special attention to version numbers and any missing categories.")

2. If the section contains Mermaid diagrams, explain each diagram briefly before offering elicitation options (e.g., "The component diagram shows the main system modules and their interactions. Notice how the API Gateway routes requests to different services.")

3. If the section contains multiple distinct items (like multiple components, multiple patterns, etc.), inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:

   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)

4. Then present the action list as specified below.]]

### 2. Ask for Review and Present Action List

[[LLM: Ask the user to review the drafted section. In the SAME message, inform them that they can suggest additions, removals, or modifications, OR they can select an action by number from the 'Advanced Reflective, Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions'. If there are multiple items in the section, mention they can specify which item(s) to apply the action to. Then, present ONLY the numbered list (0-9) of these actions. Conclude by stating that selecting 9 will proceed to the next section. Await user selection. If an elicitation action (0-8) is chosen, execute it and then re-offer this combined review/elicitation choice. If option 9 is chosen, or if the user provides direct feedback, proceed accordingly.]]

**Present the numbered list (0-9) with this exact format:**

```text
**Advanced Reflective, Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions**
Choose an action (0-9 - 9 to bypass - HELP for explanation of these options):

0. Expand or Contract for Audience
1. Explain Reasoning (CoT Step-by-Step)
2. Critique and Refine
3. Analyze Logical Flow and Dependencies
4. Assess Alignment with Overall Goals
5. Identify Potential Risks and Unforeseen Issues
6. Challenge from Critical Perspective (Self or Other Persona)
7. Explore Diverse Alternatives (ToT-Inspired)
8. Hindsight is 20/20: The 'If Only...' Reflection
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

### 2. Processing Guidelines

**Do NOT show:**

- The full protocol text with `[[LLM: ...]]` instructions
- Detailed explanations of each option unless executing or the user asks, when giving the definition you can modify to tie its relevance
- Any internal template markup

**After user selection from the list:**

- Execute the chosen action according to the protocol instructions below
- Ask if they want to select another action or proceed with option 9 once complete
- Continue until user selects option 9 or indicates completion

## Action Definitions

0. Expand or Contract for Audience
   [[LLM: Ask the user whether they want to 'expand' on the content (add more detail, elaborate) or 'contract' it (simplify, clarify, make more concise). Also, ask if there's a specific target audience they have in mind. Once clarified, perform the expansion or contraction from your current role's perspective, tailored to the specified audience if provided.]]

1. Explain Reasoning (CoT Step-by-Step)
   [[LLM: Explain the step-by-step thinking process, characteristic of your role, that you used to arrive at the current proposal for this content.]]

2. Critique and Refine
   [[LLM: From your current role's perspective, review your last output or the current section for flaws, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement, and then suggest a refined version reflecting your expertise.]]

3. Analyze Logical Flow and Dependencies
   [[LLM: From your role's standpoint, examine the content's structure for logical progression, internal consistency, and any relevant dependencies. Confirm if elements are presented in an effective order.]]

4. Assess Alignment with Overall Goals
   [[LLM: Evaluate how well the current content contributes to the stated overall goals of the document, interpreting this from your specific role's perspective and identifying any misalignments you perceive.]]

5. Identify Potential Risks and Unforeseen Issues
   [[LLM: Based on your role's expertise, brainstorm potential risks, overlooked edge cases, or unintended consequences related to the current content or proposal.]]

6. Challenge from Critical Perspective (Self or Other Persona)
   [[LLM: Adopt a critical perspective on the current content. If the user specifies another role or persona (e.g., 'as a customer', 'as [Another Persona Name]'), critique the content or play devil's advocate from that specified viewpoint. If no other role is specified, play devil's advocate from your own current persona's viewpoint, arguing against the proposal or current content and highlighting weaknesses or counterarguments specific to your concerns. This can also randomly include YAGNI when appropriate, such as when trimming the scope of an MVP, the perspective might challenge the need for something to cut MVP scope.]]

7. Explore Diverse Alternatives (ToT-Inspired)
   [[LLM: From your role's perspective, first broadly brainstorm a range of diverse approaches or solutions to the current topic. Then, from this wider exploration, select and present 2 distinct alternatives, detailing the pros, cons, and potential implications you foresee for each.]]

8. Hindsight is 20/20: The 'If Only...' Reflection
   [[LLM: In your current persona, imagine it's a retrospective for a project based on the current content. What's the one 'if only we had known/done X...' that your role would humorously or dramatically highlight, along with the imagined consequences?]]

9. Proceed / No Further Actions
   [[LLM: Acknowledge the user's choice to finalize the current work, accept the AI's last output as is, or move on to the next step without selecting another action from this list. Prepare to proceed accordingly.]]
