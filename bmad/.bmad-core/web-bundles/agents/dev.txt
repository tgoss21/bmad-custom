# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

==================== START: tasks#execute-checklist ====================
# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Context

The BMAD Method uses various checklists to ensure quality and completeness of different artifacts. Each checklist contains embedded prompts and instructions to guide the LLM through thorough validation and advanced elicitation. The checklists automatically identify their required artifacts and guide the validation process.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures
==================== END: tasks#execute-checklist ====================

==================== START: tasks#update-collaboration-log ====================
# Update Collaboration Log Task

## Purpose
Update the collaboration file with agent work summaries, decisions, and progress tracking. Each agent updates their dedicated section with work completed.

## When to Execute
- **All Agents**: After completing significant work on a story
- **All Agents**: Before handing off to another agent
- **All Agents**: When encountering blockers or making key decisions
- **All Agents**: At story completion

## Prerequisites
- Collaboration file must exist for the current story
- Agent must be working on a valid story
- Agent must have work to report

## Task Steps

### 1. Locate Collaboration File
- **Location**: `docs/collaboration/{EpicNum}.{StoryNum}.collab.md`
- **Verification**: Confirm file exists, create if missing using `create-collaboration-file` task

### 2. Identify Agent Section
Update the correct agent section based on current agent:
- **SM Agent**: "üìù Story Manager (Bob) - SM Agent"
- **Dev Agent**: "üíª Backend Developer (James) - Dev Agent"
- **Frontend-Dev Agent**: "üé® Frontend Developer (Alexa) - Frontend-Dev Agent"
- **QA Agent**: "üîç Quality Assurance (Quinn) - QA Agent"
- **Dev-Test Agent**: "üß™ Test Developer (Alex) - Dev-Test Agent"

### 3. Update Agent Section Fields

#### Required Updates for ALL Agents:
- **Last Activity**: Current date/time
- **Work Summary**: Concise description of work completed since last update
- **Handoff Notes**: Information needed by next agent(s)

#### Agent-Specific Updates:

**SM Agent**:
- Key Decisions made during story creation
- Epic context or requirements clarifications
- Story preparation insights

**Dev Agent**:
- Technical Decisions made
- Code Changes (files, components, APIs, database)
- Testing Completed (checkboxes)
- Challenges & Solutions encountered

**Frontend-Dev Agent**:
- Technical Decisions (UI/UX, architecture)

- Styling & Design changes
- Testing Completed (checkboxes)
- Challenges & Solutions

**QA Agent**:
- Test Coverage details
- Issues Found with status
- Quality Gates (checkboxes)

**Dev-Test Agent**:
- Test Implementation details
- Test Coverage Details
- Automation Setup

### 4. Update Cross-Agent Collaboration Section

#### Agent Handoffs Table
Add new row when handing off work:
```markdown
| From Agent | To Agent | Date | Handoff Notes |
|-----------|----------|------|---------------|
| SM | Dev | 2024-01-15 | Story ready for backend implementation |
```

#### Workflow Status
Update checkboxes for completed phases:
- [x] Story Creation (SM) ‚Üê Mark when SM completes
- [x] Backend Implementation (Dev) ‚Üê Mark when Dev completes
- [ ] Frontend Implementation (Frontend-Dev)
- [ ] Quality Assurance (QA)
- [ ] Test Development (Dev-Test)
- [ ] Story Completion

### 5. Update Collaboration Metrics
- Increment **Total Agent Interactions**
- Update **Story Duration** end date if completing
- Increment **Blockers Resolved** if applicable
- Update **Cross-Agent Dependencies** count

### 6. Update Footer Timestamp
- Update "Last Updated" with current timestamp and agent name

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent section updated with current work summary
- [ ] All required fields populated for agent type
- [ ] Cross-agent collaboration section updated
- [ ] Workflow status checkboxes updated appropriately
- [ ] Footer timestamp updated
- [ ] File maintains valid markdown format

## Update Guidelines

### Work Summary Best Practices
- **Be Concise**: 2-3 sentences maximum per update
- **Be Specific**: Include concrete accomplishments
- **Avoid Duplication**: Don't repeat previous updates
- **Focus on Impact**: What was achieved, not just what was done

### Technical Decisions Documentation
- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Options**: Alternatives considered (if applicable)
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why this choice was made

### Handoff Notes Guidelines
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps for receiving agent
- **Context**: Important background information
- **Risks**: Potential issues to watch for
- **Resources**: Links or references needed

## Error Handling
- **Collaboration file missing**: Execute `create-collaboration-file` task first
- **Invalid story context**: Verify current story is valid
- **File permission issues**: Report filesystem access problems
- **Markdown syntax errors**: Validate file format after updates

## Agent Integration Examples

### Dev Agent Integration
```yaml
core_principles:
  - Collaboration Updates - Update collaboration log after each major task completion
  
commands:
  - "*collab-update" - Update collaboration log with current work status
  
task-execution:

# Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

## Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.]]

## Checklist Items

1. **Requirements Met:**

   [[LLM: Be specific - list each requirement and whether it's complete]]

   - [ ] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented.
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met.

2. **Coding Standards & Project Structure:**

   [[LLM: Code quality matters for maintainability. Check each item carefully]]

   - [ ] All new/modified code strictly adheres to `Operational Guidelines`.
   - [ ] All new/modified code aligns with `Project Structure` (file locations, naming, etc.).
   - [ ] Adherence to `Tech Stack` for technologies/versions used (if story introduces or modifies tech usage).
   - [ ] Adherence to `Api Reference` and `Data Models` (if story involves API or data model changes).
   - [ ] Basic security best practices (e.g., input validation, proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets) applied for new/modified code.
   - [ ] No new linter errors or warnings introduced.
   - [ ] Code is well-commented where necessary (clarifying complex logic, not obvious statements).

3. **Testing:**

   [[LLM: Testing proves your code works. Be honest about test coverage]]

   - [ ] All required unit tests as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
   - [ ] All required integration tests (if applicable) as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
   - [ ] All tests (unit, integration, E2E if applicable) pass successfully.
   - [ ] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined).

4. **Functionality & Verification:**

   [[LLM: Did you actually run and test your code? Be specific about what you tested]]

   - [ ] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer (e.g., running the app locally, checking UI, testing API endpoints).
   - [ ] Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully.

5. **Story Administration:**

   [[LLM: Documentation helps the next developer. What should they know?]]

   - [ ] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete.
   - [ ] Any clarifications or decisions made during development are documented in the story file or linked appropriately.
   - [ ] The story wrap up section has been completed with notes of changes or information relevant to the next story or overall project, the agent model that was primarily used during development, and the changelog of any changes is properly updated.

6. **Dependencies, Build & Configuration:**

   [[LLM: Build issues block everyone. Ensure everything compiles and runs cleanly]]

   - [ ] Project builds successfully without errors.
   - [ ] Project linting passes
   - [ ] Any new dependencies added were either pre-approved in the story requirements OR explicitly approved by the user during development (approval documented in story file).
   - [ ] If new dependencies were added, they are recorded in the appropriate project files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) with justification.
   - [ ] No known security vulnerabilities introduced by newly added and approved dependencies.
   - [ ] If new environment variables or configurations were introduced by the story, they are documented and handled securely.

7. **Documentation (If Applicable):**

   [[LLM: Good documentation prevents future confusion. What needs explaining?]]

   - [ ] Relevant inline code documentation (e.g., JSDoc, TSDoc, Python docstrings) for new public APIs or complex logic is complete.
   - [ ] User-facing documentation updated, if changes impact users.
   - [ ] Technical documentation (e.g., READMEs, system diagrams) updated if significant architectural changes were made.

## Final Confirmation

[[LLM: FINAL DOD SUMMARY

After completing the checklist:

1. Summarize what was accomplished in this story
2. List any items marked as [ ] Not Done with explanations
3. Identify any technical debt or follow-up work needed
4. Note any challenges or learnings for future stories
5. Confirm whether the story is truly ready for review

Be honest - it's better to flag issues now than have them discovered later.]]

- [ ] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.
